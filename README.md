## Project Description

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry. This project aims to:

-   Explore and visualize factors contributing to customer churn.
-   Develop machine learning models to predict customer churn.
-   Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

## Data Description

The dataset `Telecom_Customer_Details.csv` contains 7043 entries with 21 columns, including customer demographics, service usage, and churn status. Key columns include:

-   `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
-   `gender`: Customer's gender (Male, Female).
-   `SeniorCitizen`: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1, 0).
-   `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes, No).
-   `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes, No).
-   `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
-   `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes, No).
-   `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes, No, No phone service).
-   `InternetService`: Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No).
-   `OnlineSecurity`: Whether the customer has online security (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   `OnlineBackup`: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   `DeviceProtection`: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   `TechSupport`: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   `StreamingTV`: Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   `StreamingMovies`: Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes, No, No internet service).
-   `Contract`: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
-   `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes, No).
-   `PaymentMethod`: The customerâ€™s payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)).
-   `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly.
-   `TotalCharges`: The total amount charged to the customer.
-   `Churn`: Whether the customer churned (Yes or No).

## Dependencies

-   pandas
-   numpy
-   matplotlib
-   seaborn
-   scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd telecom-churn-analysis
```

2.  Download the dataset `Telecom_Customer_Details.csv` and place it in the same directory as the scripts.

## Usage

1.  Run the main script to perform data cleaning, EDA, and churn analysis:

```
python churn_analysis.py
```

2.  Follow the notebook `telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb` for detailed steps and visualizations.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

-   **Missing Values**: Handled missing values in `TotalCharges` by replacing spaces with NaN and then removing rows with NaN.
-   **Data Types**: Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric type.
-   **Removed irrelevant column**: Dropped the `customerID` column as it is not needed for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   **Visualizations**:

    -   Heatmap to check for missing values.
    -   Plots to visualize the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
    -   Plots to understand relationships between categorical and numerical features with churn.

## Feature Engineering

-   Identified categorical and numerical features.
